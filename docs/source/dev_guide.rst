Writing a WPS process
---------------------

In Birdhouse we are using the :term:`PyWPS` implementation of a :term:`Web Processing Service`. Writing a WPS process in Birdhouse is the same as in PyWPS. The PyWPS documentation has a `tutorial on writing a process <http://pywps.wald.intevation.org/documentation/course/process/index.html>`_. *Please* follow this PyWPS tutorial. 

To get easier started you can install :ref:`Emu <emu:installation>` with some example processes for PyWPS.
