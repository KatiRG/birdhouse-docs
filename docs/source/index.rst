Introduction
============

Birdhouse is a collection of OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) related
Python components to support data processing in the climate science
community. The aim of Birdhouse is to make the usage of WPS easy. Most
of the OGC/WPS related software comes from the `GeoPython project <http://geopython.github.io/>`_. 

Birdhouse is the home of the following WPS components (birds):

* :ref:`Phoenix <phoenix:installation>`: a web-based WPS client with ESGF data access
* :ref:`Malleefowl <malleefowl:installation>`: access to climate data (ESGF, ...) as a service and library
* :ref:`Flyingpigeon <flyingpigeon:installation>`: services for the climate impact community
* :ref:`Hummingbird <hummingbird:installation>`: provides cdo and cfchecker as a service
* :ref:`Emu <emu:installation>`: some example WPS processes
* :ref:`Birdy <birdy:installation>`: a WPS command line tool

You can find the source code for all Birdhouse components on
`our github page <http://github.com/bird-house>`_.
