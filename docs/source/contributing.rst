Wiki
----

The `Wiki on GitHub <https://github.com/bird-house/bird-house.github.io/wiki>`_ is used for topics not covered by the Sphinx documentation yet. 


Website development
-------------------

The Birdhouse Website is on http://bird-house.github.io/. The HTML pages are `maintained on GitHub <https://github.com/bird-house/bird-house.github.io>`_.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is created with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_ and is automatically published to `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ with GitHub webhooks.

The `main documentation <https://github.com/bird-house/birdhouse-docs>`_ (which you are reading now) is the starting point to get an overview of what Birdhouse provides. Each Birdhouse component comes with its own Sphinx documentation and is referenced by the main Birdhouse document.
